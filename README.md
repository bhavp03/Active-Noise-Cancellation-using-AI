The project titled ”Adaptive Noise Cancellation System Using AI” aims to design and implement an advanced noise cancellation system that dynamically reduces unwanted ambient sounds using artificial intelligence. The system will employ a microphone array to capture environmental noise, which will then be processed in real time using sophisticated signal processing algorithms. Leveraging adaptive machine learning techniques, the system will effectively filter out unwanted noise while preserving the integrity of the desired audio. This technology is intended to enhance audio quality in various settings, from personal audio devices to large-scale industrial applications. The adaptive nature of the AI-driven approach ensures that the system continuously learns and improves its noise cancellation capabilities, making it highly efficient across different environments and noise profiles.
